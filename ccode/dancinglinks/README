- INFILE specifies a set of categories, each of which includes one or more
  objects

- OUTFILE lists all partitions of the full set of objects

- if the argument 1 is omitted, OUTFILE will show the total number of
  partitions but not list these partitions

Purpose:

from the categories specified in INFILE

dancinglinks.c is based on Donald Knuth's implementation of the dancing
links algorithm, which is available from 

http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs/dance.w

To convert this to a .c file type

> ctangle dance.w

The alterations to Knuth's original program are minor -- I changed a
couple of lines so that the program prints out all and only the
information that we need (a list of partitions, one per line, and a
concluding statement which shows the total number of partitions)
