Usage:
======

Type

scorecost @optfile.opt

where OPTFILE.OPT specifies the parameters for the run.

OPTFILE.OPT is used to set the parameters stored in the data structure ps.
Any parameter not set in OPTFILE.OPT will take the default value specified
in parameters.c. A typical .opt file is as follows


; run-specific parameters for scoring partitions
;
--outfile=PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FILE
--partfile=PATH_TO_PARTITION_FILE
--compexfile=PATH_TO_COMPEXFILE
--needfile=PATH_TO_NEEDFILE
--nhalf=5


where 

- the partition file is a list of partitions, one per line -- will
  typically be generated by running dancinglinks

- COMPEXFILE indicates the extension of each component -- ie which
  individuals belong to each category.

- NEEDFILE specifies the need probabilities for each individual

- NHALF specifies the number of individuals in the family tree for the
  first speaker. 

Purpose:
========

Score the communicative cost of the partitions in PARTITION_FILE with
respect to the need probabilities in NEEDFILE
