This directory contains the Murdock data and related scripts.

Murdock data:
----------------

These data were published in Murdock (1970), Kin term patterns and their
distribution, Ethnology, 9(2). This paper was reprinted in World Cultures,
11(1) in 2000 and we used the version of the data set on the data disk
that accompanied this reprint.

Raw data files:
-----------------
kinterm_orig.txt:  the version of the data set included in World Cultures 11(1).

kinterm_adjusted.txt: the version of the data set used for our analyses. 
Identical to kinterm_orig.txt except for the changes noted below.  

At10.cod: codes for interpreting kinterm_orig.txt and kinterm_adjusted.txt


Differences between kinterm_adjusted.txt and kinterm_orig.txt:
----------------------------------------------------------
As described in At10.cod, kinterm_orig.txt contains codes for eight kinds
of kin types: grandparents, grandchildren, uncles, aunts, niblings
(nephews and nieces), siblings, cousins, and siblings-in-law. A small
number of the codes for aunts appeared to be incorrect---they are
inconsistent with the variable descriptions in At10.cod and they do not
match the information in Murdock's original article. We removed these
errors and reconciled the electronic data set with the original article by
changing all aunt codes of (7,10) and (8,.) to (7,9) and (8,10)
respectively. kinterm_adjusted.txt includes these changes but is otherwise
identical to kinterm_orig.txt

A diagram showing numeric labels for 114 individuals in the family trees
of Alice and Bob.

rwpartitions.txt
-----------------

Partitions of the master tree for each culture in Murdock's data set. Each
row is a partition and the first entry in each row is the frequency of
that partition.  Missing entries are indicated with -1s.

We don't have data for parents, children -- so we assume that there are
four distinct terms for mother, father, son, daughter.

rwpartitions.txt is created by running 

> readkindata
> makemasterrwpartitions

from within Matlab.

- readkindata.m extracts the codes from kinterm_adjusted.txt that we'll
  need.
- makemasterrwpartitions.m combines these codes to construct partitions of
  the first 112 individuals shown in mastertree.pdf

englishpartition.txt, northernpaiute.txt:
----------------------------------------
Partitions corresponding to the systems in Fig 2.
